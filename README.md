# traits.js

A pseudo-fork of the original [traits.js](http://soft.vub.ac.be/~tvcutsem/traitsjs/) library by [Tom Van Cutsem](http://soft.vub.ac.be/soft/members/tomvancutsem).

## Motivation

By forking, retooling and experimenting with the original *traits.js*, the goal is to come to a deeper understanding of the concepts, implementation, benefits and trade-offs of traits-based composition in JavaScript.

## Goals

In time, this fork will explore the possibility of leveraging traits as a basis for *gradual typing* in JavaScript libraries, along the lines of Clojure's [core.typed](https://github.com/clojure/core.typed).

A more immediate goal is to leverage traits on top of [Google Polymer](http://www.polymer-project.org/), providing a mechanism for [Custom Element](http://www.w3.org/TR/custom-elements/) *composition* which is complementary to prototypal inheritance, e.g. the `extends` mechanism of [polymer-element](http://www.polymer-project.org/polymer.html).

## Installation

You can install the latest release via [npm](https://npmjs.org/package/traits.js):

```shell
npm install traits.js
```

It is also available through [bower](http://bower.io/):

```shell
bower install traits.js
```

## Bugs

You can report bugs and discuss features on the [issues page](http://github.com/michaelsbradleyjr/traits.js/issues) or send tweets to [@michaelsbradley](https://twitter.com/michaelsbradley).
